# Breast_cancer_detection
Breast cancer is a disease in which cells in the breast grow out of control. There are different kinds of breast cancer. The kind of breast cancer depends on which cells in the breast turn into cancer. Breast cancer can begin in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer starts when cells in the breast begin to divide and grow in an unusual and uncontrolled way. Breast cancer can start in different parts of the breast.The most common type of breast cancer starts in the ducts. The ducts are tubes in the breast that carry breast milk to the nipple. Sometimes cancer can start in the lobules. The lobules are glands that produce milk for breastfeeding. 
Breast cancer is most often diagnosed in adults over the age of 50, but it can occur at any age.

Overall, women who are non-Hispanic white have a slightly higher chance of developing breast cancer than women of any other race or ethnicity. Women who are non-Hispanic Black are almost as likely as non-Hispanic white women to develop the disease. Statistically, women who are Asian, Hispanic or Native American are the least likely to develop breast cancer.

Early detection can give patients more treatment options. In order to detect signs of cancer, breast tissue from biopsies is stained to enhance the nuclei and cytoplasm for microscopic examination. Then, pathologists evaluate the extent of any abnormal structural variation to determine whether there are tumors.
AI has become a transformational force in healthcare, computer vision models are getting a higher accuracy when researchers have the access to more medical imaging datasets.

I will develop a ML model to detect breast cancer by using Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier. Two classes will be used in this project: Benign and Malignant.

The dataset is from Kaggle. Dataset is divided into two main groups: benign tumors and malignant tumors. Histologically benign is a term referring to a lesion that does not match any criteria of malignancy - e.g., marked cellular atypia, mitosis, disruption of basement membranes, metastasize, etc. Normally, benign tumors are relatively "innocents", presents slow growing and remains localized. Malignant tumor is a synonym for cancer: lesion can invade and destroy adjacent structures (locally invasive) and spread to distant sites (metastasize) to cause death.

At first the dataset has been loaded to the jupyter notebook.
Then, the dataset is splitted into two parts; Train Data and Test Data.
